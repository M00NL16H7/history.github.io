      <h1>A menace was born</h1>
      <p>I was born in Dubois, PA on October 20th at around 10:30PM, in the now
        defunct DRMC (Dubois Regional Medical Center, now Penn Highlands)
        I dont know the specific size, but i was not a small baby according to
        my mom</p>

      <div class="1st Grade">
      <h1>1st Grade</h1>
        <p>My first grade class was at Juniata Elementry School, also in Dubois
        in 2012-2013. It was Mrs. Burns, she was not exactly nice at first, however
        as the year progressed she got better, and class was enjoyable.</p>

      <div class="favTeacher">
        <h1>Favorite Teacher</h1>
    	<p>Hmm.. this one is kinda hard, however.. I'm going to have to say Mrs. Riggs, who taght at
        York Academy in my 8th grade literature class. This was in 2019-2020,
        and she's probably gonna be my favorite for a while, as she was extremely
        helpful when there was some... erm situations going on towards the end of
        '19, that were not good at all, a lot do with toxic people that are now out of my life
        thankfully. She was very helpful with work and overall just.. was really nice.'</p>

      <div class="firstSport">
      <h1>First Sport</h1>
      <p>This was in... If im not mistaken, 2015-2016. I played for the raiders at Noonan
      park. It was peewee football, we actually weren't half bad, made it to our playoffs,
      but that game was.. actually kinda rigged lol.</p>
      </div>
      <div class ="majorFamEvent1">
       <h1>Major Family Event 1</h1>
       <p>First major family event that I can remember was probably my parents divorce. A bit
      depressing I know lol. It was complicated before it even happened, this was just
      officially. It was (officially) in the winter of 2013, and my dad moved up to Meadville for a little,
      in October of 2012, my mom met my stepdad, introduced by one of her friends, and 
      he offered for us to move in later that winter, as my mom was working 4 jobs to keep
      the roof over our heads, after I finished school at Juniata, we moved to York in 
      June of 2013. It hasn't been the same sense :)<p>
       </div>
       <div class ="majorFamEvent2">
       <p>The second family event, was recent, sadly, my step-grandfather passed away in 
      May of this year, at the very end of the school year too. He had been in the hospital
      for about a week, after he had a heart attack, and was in a semi-vegetive state,
      for give or take a week before he had passed in the hospital. This was rough as i was 
      missing the last week of school, much less important then the fact that the hospital was
      like, "oh ya he's ok, nah he's not now, now he is, now he isn't". The constant back
      and fourth was very taxing on all of us. It was hard when the news came though.
      Friday, May 29th, or 28th it's a blur, was the viewing and whatnot, was the hard part.
      to see one of your relatives, that not even a few months prior, was alive, just.. cold,
      and, filled with preservatives like some kind of.. inhumane object, so family could look at
      you dead.. was just kinda a shock to reality. 21 gun salute was the hardest part. </p>

      <div class="bestDay">
      <h1>Best day</h1>
      <p>Well... this is pretty hard considering the mindset im kinda stuck in right now
      (yes im ok, jus am focused on future) but, i'd have to say it was the day i got the 
      paper saying i got into tech, i was so happy to see this as it meant i was out of my 
      old... horrible school.</p>
